Edge cases (For each action on multiselect - move, delete)
1) Run the action when no items selected
2) Run the action when all (multiple files as well as multiple folders - the exact number to be agreed on with BA) selected
3) Run the action when an item included in the selection has been moved (e.g. it is an item inside a shared folder and other user has moved it)
4) Run the action when an item included in the selection has been deleted (e.g. it is a shared item and it has been deleted by other user)
5) Move files into a location where files with the same names already exist

Tests to be automated:
Regression testing is run frequently, against each release multiple times as the application support multiple browsers. This makes the regression tests a good candidate for automation.
Another question is what tests should be picked for regression pack. Re-running the entire test suite might become very expensive over time as the number of tests grows.
We can prioritize the tests based on business impact and frequency of usage. Keeping this in mind we might decide to automate the below tests:
1) User can delete multiple files at once
2) User can move multiple files at once
